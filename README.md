A better, more sleek community based man page effort.

## DB for pages / apps

[MannyDB](https://github.com/Milo12349/mannydb) - submit PRs here updating something in Manny's DB.

## Generic

A generic app means that the name of the app you added is already used, ie, an app with the name of `action` wouldn't work as there is an action command. To bypass this, simply type `manny manifest action` rather than `manny action`.

## How

Manny is an enfort to help get more info on apps you love via the CLI. There is a seperate repo, [MannyDB](https://github.com/Milo123459/mannydb) which is where your app information is stored. If you want to add your app to manny, or update it, you submit a PR there. On the repo you will find contribution guidelines. Make sure to follow them!

After adding, you can type `manny update`, which will update the DB locally. It is stored in the home dir: `$HOME/.manny/db`
This DB folder is a cloned version of the DB repo. You need to have git installed. When you run it for the first time, each time you run a command, it checks if the DB is present. If not, it'll clone it. This should only take a few seconds. Once cloned, every file ending with `.md` will then be an app you can later get info on.

Manny's CLI / core (the repo you are on) is written in Rust. This allows the CLI to be ridiculously fast. 

If you have any other questions, please create an issue! I'll try and help out ASAP. (Please don't make issues on the MannyDB repo, there isn't a point).

## Lifecycle

`manny update` => Clone, or pull the git repository located in `$HOME/.manny/db`.<br>
`manny app <app>` => Seacrh through the DB (located in `$HOME/.manny/db`) for an app with the name which is provided. If found, display and render the markdown.<br>
`manny is <app>` => Search through the DB (located in `$HOME/.manny/db`) and see if the app with the name provided is in the DB.<br>
